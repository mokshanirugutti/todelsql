They act as a barrier, preventing attacks from enemies and keeping the person behind them safe. Similarly, the community of microorganisms in your gastrointestinal tract, called the gut microbiome, creates a protective layer to shield them from threats like antibiotics and other environmental stressors. Though biofilm formation is a completely natural process, sometimes, an overgrowth can provide a protective barrier behind which harmful microbes may proliferate, leading to digestive issues and chronic inflammation or even conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO).Gut biofilms play a significant role in maintaining gut health.
